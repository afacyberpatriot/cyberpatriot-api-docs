# API Reference

The CyberPatriot API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms) request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes and verbs.

###### BASE URL

```
https://scoreboard.uscyberpatriot.org/api
```

All API requests should be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure).

## User Agent

Please provide a valid [User Agent](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#section-10.1.5) which specifies your contact information. (Specifically, the contact info of the person that maintains the code sending the automated requests, *not* the contact info of the person using the script.)

Bonus points if you also include a URL where we can check out your script!

###### USER AGENT EXAMPLE

```
User-Agent: github.com/matthewzring/cyberscores by m@tthewzri.ng
```

## Errors

We use conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed.

You are expected to make reasonable attempts to avoid making invalid requests. If a request returns a **404** status you should not attempt to use it again.

## Rate Limits

Rate limits exist across CyberPatriot's APIs to prevent spam, abuse, and service overload. If you create any kind of automated tool that touches the CyberPatriot servers, *you* are responsible for ensuring that it does not hammer the CyberPatriot servers.

Avoid sending more than one request per second.

## Timestamps

The format for Date/Times returned in our models will be as it appears on the scoreboard, usually in `m/d H:i` format.

## Nullable and Optional Data Fields

Data fields that may contain a `null` value will be marked as nullable. Data fields that are returned when available have types that are marked as optional.

âš  If you do not see some of the parameters in your API response it means that they are not displayed on the public scoreboard.

## Data Formatting

We use the default format expected by [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) to display and return information.

## Chart Data

We utilize the [Google Visualization API](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference) format for chart data returned in our models.

## Bulk Requests

Most endpoints support multiple parameters per request. You can specify up to **32** teams in one request.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: This also works in the native scoreboard, for example:

```
https://scoreboard.uscyberpatriot.org/?team[]=17-1141&team[]=17-0224&team[]=17-0555
```
